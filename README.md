Modelling the disease spread.

The approach is based on combining two general strategies to infection modelling: using [Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered/Removed (SIR)](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/loci/joma/the-sir-model-for-spread-of-disease-the-differential-equation-model) model for the city-level spread, and simultaneously modelling the spread of the decease through the air-traffic network.

Intermediate results of the modelling can be found on plots below.
