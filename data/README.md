# Data sources

We use a collection of datasets, describing the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

The data includes:
- `airport_df.csv` world airport locations and connections (provided by [openflights.org](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/airports.dat))
- `routes.csv` estimated number of flights per month between the airports (parsed from https://www.flightconnections.com/)
- `city_population.csv`, `country_population.csv` estimated population on country and city level (http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/)
- current outbreak monitoring data, provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) on the number of confirmed, recovered, and death cases (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data).
